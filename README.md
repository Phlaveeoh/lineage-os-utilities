This is a bunch of tools useful for the installing of Lineage OS 18.1 and Gapps on a Xiaomi Mi Pad 4!

To learn how to install Lineage OS follow this [guide](https://www.getdroidtips.com/lineageos-18-xiaomi-mi-pad-4-4-plus/).

You will have to download the Lineage rom and the Gapps (I recommend "Mind the Gapps").
If you carefully follow all the steps in the guide I linked you will surely have no problem at all with the installing.
